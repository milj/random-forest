# random-forest (WIP)

A random forest classifier written from scratch in Python. Learning and playing with it this way is more fun that just using `scikit`.

The accuracy on the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) (as it is, no feature engineering) is around 75%.

Usage:
```
./classifier.py -t "target column name" training.csv test.csv
```
