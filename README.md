# random-forest (WIP)

A random forest classifier (being) written from scratch in Python. Playing with it this way is more fun that just using `scikit`.
The end goal it to apply it to the Titanic dataset and see how well it performs.

Usage:
```
./classifier.py --target_column "foobar" training.csv test.csv
```
